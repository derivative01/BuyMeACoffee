# Sample Hardhat Project

BuyMeACoffee deployed on Goerli: `0xF7d4B788cea2EB1F7706E334C834423c10cD3384`

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
